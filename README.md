# Basic Info
1. My PC is very very old and I had an azure subscription so I setup the VM on there. The azure doesn't have a default image of fedora ready, but the fedora project provides one so a manual upload was in order. I eventually did it on a virtualbox on my PC, it was very slow but azure wasn't very cooperative with using fedora as an image.
